The Slumber Slayer is a unique alarm clock created to constantly initiate users in physical and mental tasks to awaken them from their sleep. The main goal of this project is to construct a contraption that not only interrupts a user's sleep cycle but also entails that the user is hypervigilant and not able to return to slumber effective immediately. Established alarm clocks simply create sound effects that may not successfully awake users, especially those who can easily fall back to sleep. The Slumber Slayer addresses this problem by including a mixture of kinetic-based activities and analytical challenges as a feature of the alarm "snooze/Reset" process.
